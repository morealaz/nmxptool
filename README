NMXPTOOL AND LIBNMXP : OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE FOR
                      NANOMETRICS SEISMIC DATA TRANSMISSION

  nmxptool and libnmxp have been developed for interacting
  with NaqsServer and DataServer.

- INTRODUCTION

nmxptool is based on libnmxp.

The library offers APIs to:
    * interact with NaqsServer that uses
      version 1.4 of the Private Data Stream Protocol
    * interact with DataServer that uses
      version 1.0 of the Nanometrics Data Access Protocol
    * manage Nanometrics data formats
    * request, receive and interpret online and offline data

moreover, you can use them to develop software to:
    * analyze data in realtime (waveforms, triggers, ...)
    * retrieve and convert on the fly data
      into the mini-SEED records (optional)
    * feed SeedLink server (optional)


- DOCUMENTATION
    * ./nmxptool -h
    * Earthworm module: earthworm/nmxptool_cmd.html
                                  nmxptool_ovr.html

- DEPENDENCIES
  Optional libraries:

    * Earthworm 6.2 or later: http://www.isti2.com/ew/

    * libmseed-2.1.4 or later: http://www.iris.edu/manuals/
      The Mini-SEED library. A C library framework for manipulating and
      managing SEED data records.  Author: Chad Trabant, IRIS DMC


- QUICK INSTALLATION
     cd libnmxp
     ./configure
     make
     cd ..
     ./configure
     make
     cp src/nmxptool <where_you_want>


- INSTALLATION
  nmxptool and libnmxp have been developed using GNU Build Tools
  (automake, autoconf and configure script) taking in account the
  POSIX Cross-Platform aspects. So you should be able to compile
  and install them everywhere you can launch the following commands:

     ./configure
     make
     make install

    Optional Packages:
      --without-libmseed      disable support for libmseed
      --without-ew            disable support for earthworm
      --without-seedlink      disable support for seedlink

    * libmseed, if available within includes and libraries path,
                this library will enable Mini-SEED support.

    * ew, compiling depends on environment variables $EW_HOME, $EW_VERSION
          `configure` look for necessary earthworm object files inside $EW_HOME/$EW_VERSION/lib
           and link them to nmxptool in order to enable Earthworm support.
           If some object file is missing then it will attempt to discover sources
           dependents on your operating system and compile them before linking.

    * seedlink, inside the directory `src` has been copied files
                `seedlink_plugin.c` and `seedlink_plugin.h` from `plugin.c` and `plugin.h`
                 belonging to the SeisComP 2.x distribution
