TODO LIST:

- Check option -k MUST BE THE LAST!

- Check params for different protocol PDS and DAP

- Params for DAP, <start_time> <interval_time>, for example 2007/08/11,00:00:00 30s

- Exit conditions for PDS loop
	* after t time amount of data, for example 10 seconds of data
	* after n packets, for example like "ping"

- Improved "delay" way avoiding to open and close the socket
