        to match the desired channels. (involved options -C, -l, -L)
    - Added feature: accept 'telnet' connection for monitoring data
        and diagnostic purposes. (option -E)
    - Improved connection management. Exit from program only on request,

    - Improved signal handling using safe threads.
    - Improved request of channels using a separate thread.
    - Improved printing of info about Raw Stream data buffer. (Signal -ALRM).

* Release 1.2.1    (2008/03/31) 
    - Improved request of channels in order to retrieve more efficiently
        data buffered by the NaqsServer (option -F and -b).
        It allows data continuity, to the latency's cost,
        when short disconnections to the NaqsServer occur.
        Added option --mschan=mSECs/nC, short option -f.
    - Added on Windows system, computation of the packet latencies
        when timezone is different from GMT/UTC.
    - Changed 'configure' options from --with-PACKAGE to --enable-FEATURE.
    - Improved signal handling.
    - Improved help and documentation.
    - Option "delay" can be declared in minutes, hours or days (option -d).

* Release 1.1.8     (2008/03/03)
    - Added management of channel sample sequences.
        Allow data continuity between program restarts, (option -F)
        within time defined by MaxDataToRetrieve (option -A)
        and data buffered by the DataServer and NaqsServer.
    - Added support for retrieving Data-On-Demand
        with minimum delay from NaqsServer (option -T).
    - Added option "buffered time" for a single channel (options -b, -B).
    - Added ten thousandth of second in date format (option -s, -e).
    - Added check for duplication in channel pattern declaration (options -F, -C).
    - Added logging of sample values (option -G).
    - Option "interval" can be declared in minutes, hours or days (option -t).
    - Fixed major bug in DAP authentication (options -u and -p).
    - Fixed bug in packet decompression on Big-Endian architecture.
        Offset +1 count was added when x0 was greater than zero.
    - Countless minor bug fixes and improvements.

* Release 1.1.7     (2007/12/11)
    - Added support for WindowsXP and Windows2000 (compilation under MinGW).
    - Added support for recompiling earthworm sources when object files are missing.
