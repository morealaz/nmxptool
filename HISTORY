* Release 1.2.5-beta1    (2010/08/26) 
    - Added feature: enabled ShortTermCompletion also in Earthworm configuration.
        (Short-Term-Completion has been implemented in NaqsServer version 2.1)
    - Added feature: within state file it is allowed to insert white spaces and tabs,
         and comment string by '#'. (involved option -F)
    - Added capability, using libmseed, to choose between steim1 and steim2
        compression (option -x), and data quality indicator (option -q). (R. Racine)
    - Fixed some memory leaks and potential other memory bugs. (R. Racine)

* Release 1.2.4    (2009/12/22) 
    - Fixed major bugs: made code thread safe substituting functions
        and removing static variables from own functions. (S. Pintore)
    - Improved saving of mini-SEED files into SDS and BUD structure,
        now it is possible to store mini-SEED in near-real-time from NaqsServer.
    - Added feature: packets converted in mini-SEED records can be directly sent
        to the Seedlink server by the function send_mseed(), in place of using
        the function send_raw_depoch(). (option -K or -k).
    - Changed SeisComP templates adding source port to the file name of channel list.
    - Added SeisComP templates for retrieving Data On Demand with minimun delay.
    - Added minor feature: declare timing_quality from the command-line. (option -Q).

* Release 1.2.3    (2009/01/15) 
    - Added feature: mini-SEED files can be saved directly within a
        SeisComP Data Structure (SDS) or Buffer of Uniform Data (BUD)
        (changed option -m, new option -o).
    - Improvement: changed HIGHEST_TIMEOUT to 30 seconds in order to
        handle the signals whenever data is not coming through.
    - Fixed bug: Windows binary distribution now contains
        "pthreadVC2.dll" that it has been compiled by MSVC++6.0

* Release 1.2.2    (2008/07/23) 
    - Added feature: channel list can be printed declaring a pattern
        to match the desired channels. (involved options -C, -l, -L)
    - Added feature: accept 'telnet' connection for monitoring data
        and diagnostic purposes. Not available on Windows yet. (option -E)
    - Improved connection management. Exit from program only on request,
        that is, receving termination signal or ew-flag-terminate.
    - Improved signal handling using safe threads.
    - Improved request of channels using a separate thread.
    - Improved printing of info about Raw Stream data buffer. (Signal -ALRM).
    - Improved function nmxp_openSocket().
    - Added 'pluginid' to prefix log messages when launched as Seedlink plug-in.
    - Fixed bug: on Solaris system set a time-out using select() and recv()
        in order to quit properly the program when any data is received.

* Release 1.2.1    (2008/03/31) 
    - Improved request of channels in order to retrieve more efficiently
        data buffered by the NaqsServer (option -F and -b).
        It allows data continuity, to the latency's cost,
        when short disconnections to the NaqsServer occur.
        Added option --mschan=mSECs/nC, short option -f.
    - Added on Windows system, computation of the packet latencies
        when timezone is different from GMT/UTC.
    - Changed 'configure' options from --with-PACKAGE to --enable-FEATURE.
    - Improved signal handling.
    - Improved help and documentation.
    - Option "delay" can be declared in minutes, hours or days (option -d).
    - Fixed bug: before exiting, error message "double free" rarely occurred.
    - Fixed bug: on Windows, argument of function Sleep() is in milliseconds.
    - Fixed minor bugs.

* Release 1.2.0     (2008/03/07)
   - Reorganized structure of directories.
        Compilation in a single shot of configure and make.
   - Added UserDAP and PassDAP in Earthworm configuration files.

* Release 1.1.8     (2008/03/03)
    - Added management of channel sample sequences.
        Allow data continuity between program restarts, (option -F)
        within time defined by MaxDataToRetrieve (option -A)
        and data buffered by the DataServer and NaqsServer.
    - Added support for retrieving Data-On-Demand
        with minimum delay from NaqsServer (option -T).
    - Added option "buffered time" for a single channel (options -b, -B).
    - Added ten thousandth of second in date format (option -s, -e).
    - Added check for duplication in channel pattern declaration (options -F, -C).
    - Added logging of sample values (option -G).
    - Option "interval" can be declared in minutes, hours or days (option -t).
    - Fixed major bug in DAP authentication (options -u and -p).
    - Fixed bug in packet decompression on Big-Endian architecture.
        Offset +1 count was added when x0 was greater than zero.
    - Countless minor bug fixes and improvements.

* Release 1.1.7     (2007/12/11)
    - Added support for WindowsXP and Windows2000 (compilation under MinGW).
    - Added support for recompiling earthworm sources when object files are missing.
